## About me
Hi, I'm Adrian! I am a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](https://web.ml.tu-berlin.de) at TU Berlin,
where my research interests lie in automatic differentiation, explainability and dynamical systems.
I'm a huge fan of the Julia programming language and its community. 

I like to spend my free time on FOSS, image processing, board games, good coffee, and on my bike.
Some day I'm going to find the time to learn Rust.

## Projects
I've authored a course on [Julia Programming for Machine Learning](https://github.com/adrhill/julia-ml-course) and built a bunch of packages.
